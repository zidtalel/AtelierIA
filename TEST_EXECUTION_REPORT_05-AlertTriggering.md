## Summary

This report will be updated after running the tests. The tests implement the cases described in `Features/05-AlertTriggering.md` and rely on helper endpoints `/api/test/*` and `/api/test/control/*` to inject values and trigger monitors deterministically.

Refer to `AI_changelog.md` for changes made to `src/main` to support testing.
